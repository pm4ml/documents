NOTE: The intermediate chain must be presented as a single file. If your intermediate chain is made up of multiple files, combine them into one file in the following order: host certificate first, then the certificate that signs it, then the certificate that signs the previous certificate, and so on. Go from the most specific certificate to the least specific certificate, with each certificate verifying the previous one. *Is this true?*
