The CA used to sign the Hub's TLS client certificate can be your own self-signed CA or a trusted third-party CA. {connection-wizard} uses the DFSP CA details added here to validate that the Hub TLS client certificate was signed by the DFSP's CA.

=== Upload certificates

To record details of your CA, complete the following steps:

1. Upload the root certificate of your CA. In the *DFSP Root Certificate* field, click **Choose File**, and select the root certificate saved on your computer.

On uploading the certificates, they are validated. To see validation rules, click **View Details**. The following details are validated:

* The root certificate is a root certificate indeed. It can be self-signed or signed by a global root. *Is this true?*
* The root and intermediate CA certificates must have the CA basic constraint extension (CA = true) and the keyCertSign key usage extension. *Is this true?*
* The intermediate chain is made up of valid CAs and the top of the chain is signed by the root. *Is this true?*
