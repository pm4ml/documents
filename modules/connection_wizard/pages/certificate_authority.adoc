= Certificate Authority

The *Certificate Authority* page allows you to:

* record details of the Certificate Authority (CA) that you use to sign the Hub's TLS client certificate
* retrieve the root certificate of the Hub' CA for installing in your outbound gateway

== DFSP CA certificates

The CA used to sign the Hub's TLS client certificate can be your own self-signed CA or a trusted third-party CA. If you wish to use your own self-signed CA and you need help creating it, xref:appendix_create_tls_cert.adoc[Appendix A: Create TLS certificates] provides detailed information about the required steps:

NOTE: Some of the cross-references provided below take you to sections that talk about server certificates, and this might be confusing. The instructions in those sections are valid for all types of certificates.

It is the exported certificate files that you will upload to {connection-wizard}.

{connection-wizard} uses the DFSP CA details added here to validate that the Hub TLS client certificate was signed by your CA.

=== Upload certificates

To record details of your CA, complete the following steps:

. Upload the root certificate of your CA. In the *DFSP Root Certificate* field, click **Choose File**, and select the root certificate saved on your computer.
. Upload the intermediate certificate of your CA. In the *DFSP Intermediate Chain* field, click **Choose File**, and select the intermediate certificate saved on your computer.

include::partial$intermediate_chain_as_single_file.adoc[]

On uploading the certificates, they are validated. To see validation rules or issues found during validation, click **View Details**. The following details are validated:

* The root certificate is a root certificate indeed. It can be self-signed or signed by a global root.
* The root and intermediate CA certificates must have the CA basic constraint extension (CA = true) and the keyCertSign key usage extension.
* The intermediate chain is made up of valid CAs and the top of the chain is signed by the root.
