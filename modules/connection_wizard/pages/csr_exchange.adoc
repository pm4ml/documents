= CSR Exchange

The *CSR Exchange* page allows you to:

* submit a <<csr,certificate signing request (CSR)>> to the Hub to request that your TLS client certificate be signed by the Hub's Certificate Authority (CA)
* view the status of <<sent_csrs,sent CSRs>> and view or download the CSR or the signed certificate itself

To create a CSR for sending to the Hub, complete the following steps:

1. Go to the *CSR* tab.
2. In the *CSR* field, click **Choose File**, and select the CSR file saved on your computer.
3. Click *Submit* to send the CSR to the Hub.

NOTE: On uploading a CSR, {connection-wizard} renames the file so that the file name includes information about the name of the DFSP. This means that you will see the original file name of your CSR change to a value assigned by {connection-wizard}.

NOTE: If you have accidentally uploaded the wrong CSR, you can re-upload a new CSR and that will replace the old one. *Is this true?*

== Sent CSRs[[sent_csrs]]

The *Status* indicator displays the status of your sent CSR. If it says **CSR created**, then that means that the CSR has been signed.

If *Status* says *Certificate created*, that means that *???*

//If the CSR has been signed by the Hub using an external CA, an information label is displayed indicating exactly which external CA was used.

To view a CSR, click **View CSR**. A dialog box pops up displaying your CSR.

Information about the validity of CSRs and certificates is also displayed. Click *View Details* for information on possible validity issues. The following details are validated:

* The CSR's signature must match the public key.
* The CSR's signature algorithm must be "sha256WithRSAEncryption". Note that the validation also accepts "sha512WithRSAEncryption". *Is this true?*
* The CSR public key length must be 4096 bits.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same public key.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same Subject information.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same Common Name (CN) information.
* The CSR must have all mandatory Distinguished Name attributes. These are: Common Name (CN), Organizational Unit (OU), Organization (O), Locality (L), State (ST), Country (C), and Email Address (E). *Is this true?*
* The certificate must be valid at the present time according to the certificate validity period.
* The certificate's signature algorithm must be "sha256WithRSAEncryption".
//* The certificate public key must match the private key used to sign the CSR. Only available if the CSR was manually created ({connection-wizard} has the private key) instead of uploaded.
