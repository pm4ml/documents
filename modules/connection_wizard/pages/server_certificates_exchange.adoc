=== Upload certificates

To upload your CA-signed TLS server certificate chain, complete the following steps:

NOTE: If your server certificate has been signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, then uploading the root and intermediate certificates of your CA is optional. +
If your server certificate has been self-signed by your own Certificate Authority, uploading the root certificate of your CA is mandatory, while the intermediate certificate is optional.
