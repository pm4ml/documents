= Phase 1: Business Setup

In Phase 1 of the onboarding journey, the Hub Operator sets up identifiers for the DFSP and shares them through the *Phase 1: Business Setup* section of the {connection-wizard}.

The identifiers displayed in the *Phase 1: Business Setup* section are read-only information and cannot be edited by DFSPs.

The following identifiers are displayed:

* *DFSP Name*: The name of the DFSP.
* *DFSP ID*: The unique identifier of the DFSP.

NOTE: Both the name and the ID must be the same as the `fspId` registered in the Hub.

NOTE: If you have access to multiple environments in {connection-wizard}, it may happen that in some environments the Hub Operator has not yet added your identifiers, and therefore the *DFSP Name* and *DFSP ID* fields will be empty.
