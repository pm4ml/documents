You can search for a certificate by typing a keyword in the *Search DFSP JWS Certificates* search box and pressing *Enter*. In addition, if you select the *Show only in the same monetary zone* checkbox, then only the JWS certificates of those DFSPs will be displayed that are in the same monetary zone as you. 

NOTE: DFSPs can only download the JWS certificates of other DFSPs within the same monetary zone. For other DFSPs in a different monetary zone, the *Download* button is disabled.

Information about the validity of the certificate is also displayed. Click *View Details* for information on possible validity issues. The following details are validated:

* The certificate must be valid at the present time according to the certificate validity period.
* The certificate key length must be 2048 bits.

To download the certificate, click **Download**.

NOTE: After downloading another DFSP's or the Hub's JWS certificate, remember to extract the public key. You can extract a public key from a JWS certificate using the following openssl command: 

`openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in <jwscert>.pem > <jwspubkey>.pem`
