= JWS Certificates

Each DFSP must have a JSON Web Signature (JWS) certificate from the other DFSPs and from the Hub.

The *JWS Certificates* page allows you to:

* upload your own JWS certificate
* retrieve the JWS certificate of other DFSPs or the Hub

=== Upload certificates

To upload your JWS certificate chain, complete the following steps.

*Prerequisites:*

You have created a "wrapped" public key for uploading. For details on how this is done, see xref:appendix_create_jws_cert.adoc[Appendix A: Create a JWS certificate].

*Steps:*

. In the *JWS Certificate* field, click **Choose File**, and select your JWS certificate saved on your computer. 
. Uploading an intermediate chain is optional. To upload an intermediate chain, in the *Intermediate Chain* field, click **Choose File**, and select the JWS certificate chain saved on your computer.
. Click **Submit**. On submitting certificates, they are validated. To see validation rules or issues found during validation, click **View Details**. The following details are validated:
* The certificate must be valid at the present time according to the certificate validity period.
* The certificate key length must be 2048 bits.

You can search for a certificate by typing a keyword in the *Search DFSP JWS Certificates* search box and pressing *Enter*. In addition, if you select the *Show only in the same monetary zone* checkbox, then only the JWS certificates of those DFSPs will be displayed that are in the same monetary zone as you. 

NOTE: DFSPs can only download the JWS certificates of other DFSPs within the same monetary zone. For other DFSPs in a different monetary zone, the *Download* button is disabled.

Information about the validity of a certificate is also displayed. Click *View Details* for validation rules or issues found during validation. The following details are validated:

* The certificate must be valid at the present time according to the certificate validity period.
* The certificate key length must be 2048 bits.

To download the certificate, click **Download**.

[NOTE]
====
After downloading another DFSP's or the Hub's JWS certificate, remember to extract the public key. You can extract a public key from a JWS certificate using the following openssl command:

`openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in <jwscert>.pem > <jwspubkey>.pem`

Alternatively, you can use the KeyStore Explorer tool. For details, see xref:appendix_extract_public_key_from_JWS_cert.adoc[Appendix B: Extract a public key from a JWS certificate].
