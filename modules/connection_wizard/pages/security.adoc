= {hub} security

== Overview
Any implementation of a {hub} Hub employs the following security measures:

* *Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)* secures the communication channel for bi-directional asynchronous connections.
* *OAuth 2* is used to provide role-based access to Hub endpoints (API authorization).
* *IP whitelisting* reduces the attack surface of the Hub.
* *JSON Web Signature (JWS)* as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515[RFC 7515] (JSON Web Signature (JWS)) ensures the Payer DFSP and the Payee DFSP can trust that messages shared between each other have not been modified by a third party.
* *Interledger Protocol (ILP)* ensures the integrity of transfers and that the agreement between parties to make a transfer is binding. Any transfer is preceded by a preparation step to generate a condition that has to be fulfilled for the transfer to happen. The condition and the fulfilment also act as cryptographic proof that a transaction is secure and that messages exchanged between DFSPs have not been tampered with.

Putting the above security measures into practice requires extensive information sharing and technical configuration from different teams in both DFSP and Hub entities. This is where {connection-wizard} can help. It facilitates the sharing of mTLS and JWS digital certificates, as well as endpoint information in a guided way.

The next sections provide background information about the processes that {connection-wizard} facilitates.


== Certificates

=== TLS certificates[[tls_certificates]]

Two-way TLS or mutual TLS authentication relies on both parties (client and server) sharing their public certificates with each other and performing verification/validation based on that.

The following high-level steps describe how connection is established and data is transferred between a client and server in the case of mTLS:

. The client requests a protected resource over the HTTPS protocol and the SSL/TLS handshake process begins.
. The server returns its public certificate to the client along with a server hello. 
. The client validates/verifies the received certificate. The client verifies the certificate through the Certificate Authority (CA) for CA-signed certificates.
. If the server certificate was validated successfully, the server requests the client certificate, and the client will provide its public certificate to the server.
. The server validates/verifies the received certificate. The server verifies the certificate through the Certificate Authority for CA-signed certificates.
. After completion of the handshake process, the client and server communicate and transfer data with each other encrypted with the secret keys shared between the two during the handshake. 

The above process requires that before connecting to any environment (pre-production or production), the DFSP and the Hub each complete the following steps.

*TLS server certificates:*

. Create a server certificate signed by your CA.
. Share your server certificate and CA chain with the other party.
. Install the other party's server certificate and CA chain in your firewall (validation/verification will happen against these installed certificates).

*TLS client certificates:*

. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and share with the other party.
. Sign the other party's CSR using your CA.
. Share the signed client certificate as well as your CA's root certificate with the other party.
. Install your own client certificate signed by the other party's CA in your API gateway.
. Install the root certificate of the other party's CA in your firewall.

=== JWS certificates

Whenever an API client sends an API message to a counterparty, the API client should sign the message using its JWS private key. After the counterparty receives the API message, it must validate the signature with the sending partyâ€™s public JWS key. JWS is used by the receiving party to validate that the message came from the expected sender, and that it has not been modified in transit.

The above process requires that all DFSPs and the Hub itself have a JWS certificate and that before connecting to any environment (pre-production or production), the DFSP and the Hub each complete the following steps:

. Create a keystore (to hold your certificate and private key), an asymmetric key pair (a public key and a private key), and an associated certificate that identifies you.
. Share your JWS public key.
. Install the other parties' (Hub and all other DFSPs) JWS public key in your JWS keystore.

== Endpoint information

The Hub and the DFSPs share endpoint information to:

* whitelist the other party's public IP addresses in firewall rules in order to allow traffic
* configure the other party's callback URLs in API gateways
