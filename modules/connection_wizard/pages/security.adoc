= {hub} security

== Overview
Any implementation of a {hub} Hub employs the following security measures:

* *Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)* secures the communication channel for bi-directional asynchronous connections.
* *OAuth 2* is used to provide role-based access to Hub endpoints (API authorization).
* *IP whitelisting* reduces the attack surface of the Hub.
* *JSON Web Signature (JWS)* as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515[RFC 7515] (JSON Web Signature (JWS)) ensures the Payer DFSP and the Payee DFSP can trust that messages shared between each other have not been modified by a third party.
* *Interledger Protocol (ILP)* ensures the integrity of transfers and that the agreement between parties to make a transfer is binding. Any transfer is preceded by a preparation step to generate a condition that has to be fulfilled for the transfer to happen. The condition and the fulfilment also act as cryptographic proof that a transaction is secure and that messages exchanged between DFSPs have not been tampered with.

Putting the above security measures into practice requires extensive information sharing and technical configuration from different teams in both DFSP and Hub entities. This is where {connection-wizard} can help. It facilitates the sharing of mTLS and JWS digital certificates, as well as endpoint information in a guided way.

The next sections provide background information about the processes that {connection-wizard} facilitates.


== Certificates

=== TLS certificates[[tls_certificates]]

Two-way TLS or mutual TLS authentication relies on both parties (client and server) sharing their public certificates with each other and performing verification/validation based on that.

The following high-level steps describe how connection is established and data is transferred between a client and server in the case of mTLS:

. The client requests a protected resource over the HTTPS protocol and the SSL/TLS handshake process begins.
. The server returns its public certificate to the client along with a server hello. 
. The client validates/verifies the received certificate. The client verifies the certificate through the Certificate Authority (CA) for CA-signed certificates.
. If the server certificate was validated successfully, the server requests the client certificate.
. The client provides its public certificate to the server.
. The server validates/verifies the received certificate. The server verifies the certificate through the Certificate Authority for CA-signed certificates.

After completion of the handshake process, the client and server communicate and transfer data with each other encrypted with the secret keys shared between the two during the handshake.

The above process requires that before connecting to any environment (pre-production or production), the DFSP and the Hub each complete the following steps.

*TLS server certificates:*

|====================
|Step  |Details  |Instructions for DFSPs 
|1  |Create a server certificate signed by your CA.  |For detailed instructions, see xref:appendix_create_tls_cert.adoc[Appendix A: Create TLS certificates]. Alternatively, use your own method for creating your certificate. 
|2  |Share your server certificate and CA chain with the other party. | For detailed instructions, see section xref:server_certificates_exchange.adoc[Server Certificates Exchange].
|3  |Install the other party's server certificate and CA chain in your firewall (validation/verification will happen against these installed certificates).  |Controlled by the DFSP's Security team.

*TLS client certificates:*

|Step  |Details  |Instructions for DFSPs
|1  |Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and share with the other party.  |You have the option to auto-generate a CSR; for details, see section xref:certificate_authority.adoc[Certificate Authority]. Alternatively, you can also manually generate a CSR using your own method or following instructions in xref:appendix_create_tls_cert.adoc[Appendix A: Create TLS certificates]. +

For detailed instructions on how to share your CSR, see section xref:csr_exchange.adoc[CSR Exchange]. 
|2  |Sign the other party's CSR using your CA. |Controlled by the DFSP's Security team.
|3  |Share the signed client certificate as well as your CA's root certificate with the other party. |For detailed instructions on how to share your CA's root certificate, see section xref:certificate_authority.adoc[Certificate Authority].
|4  |Install your own client certificate signed by the other party's CA in your API gateway. |For detailed instructions on how to retrieve your signed client certificate, see section xref:csr_exchange.adoc[CSR Exchange].
|5  |Install the root certificate of the other party's CA in your firewall.  |For detailed instructions on how to retrieve the root certificate of the Hub's CA, see section xref:certificate_authority.adoc[Certificate Authority].

=== JWS certificates

Whenever an API client sends an API message to a counterparty, the API client should sign the message using its JWS private key. After the counterparty receives the API message, it must validate the signature with the sending partyâ€™s public JWS key. JWS is used by the receiving party to validate that the message came from the expected sender, and that it has not been modified in transit.

The above process requires that all DFSPs and the Hub itself have a JWS certificate and that before connecting to any environment (pre-production or production), the DFSP and the Hub each complete the following steps:

.JWS certificates
[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,6,6"]
|====================
|Step  |Details  |Instructions for DFSPs 
|1  |Create a keystore (to hold your certificate and private key), an asymmetric key pair (a public key and a private key), and an associated certificate that identifies you.  |For detailed instructions on how to generate JWS certificates, see xref:appendix_create_jws_cert.adoc[Appendix B: Create a JWS certificate]. Alternatively, use your own method for creating your certificates.
|2  |Share your JWS public key. |For detailed instructions, see section xref:jws_certificates.adoc[JWS Certificates].
|3  |Install the other parties' (the Hub and all other DFSPs) JWS public key in your JWS keystore. |For detailed instructions on how to retrieve the other parties' JWS certificate chain, see section xref:jws_certificates.adoc[JWS Certificates]. +

For details on how extract a JWS public key from a certificate chain, see xref:appendix_extract_public_key_from_JWS_cert.adoc[Appendix C: Extract a public key from a JWS certificate].

== Endpoint information

The Hub and the DFSPs share endpoint information to:

* whitelist the other party's public IP addresses in firewall rules in order to allow traffic
* configure the other party's callback URLs in API gateways

Typically, access to any incoming and outgoing traffic for a DFSP will be controlled by the relevant Security team. The DFSP's firewall needs to be appropriately configured:

* to access the Hub in any environment where the DFSP and the Hub interact, and
* for the Hub to make callbacks to the {product-name} of the DFSP

Apart from access to and from the Hub deployed in an environment, all other public access should be blocked to prevent any unauthorised/unwarranted access.

Accordingly, access to the Hub is also regulated. DFSPs have to share their IP address/IP address range from which calls will be made to the Hub so that the firewall on the Hub can be configured appropriately. The Security team within the DFSP should be able to provide that information.

For detailed instructions on how to share endpoint information with the Hub Operator and retrieve the endpoint details of the Hub, see section xref:endpoints.adoc[Endpoints].
