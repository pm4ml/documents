= Getting started with the {sdk}

The {sdk} Scheme Adapter is provided via the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/modusintegration/mojaloop-connector. It is also available as a pre-built Docker image via the Docker Hub repository: https://hub.docker.com/r/mojaloop/sdk-scheme-adapter. *Question: Is the Docker info correct?*

This Docker image contains the Scheme Adapter, which exemplifies the use of the Standard Components (to perform the operations related to security and header processing). The Scheme Adapter comes with a set of configuration options to allow DFSPs to define scheme-specific ways of working. Configuration values are provided by DFSPs as environment variables in an environment file, which is passed to the Docker container when running it. For further details on Sheme Adapter configuration options, see xref:???.adoc[Configuring the {sdk} (Scheme Adapter)].

The Standard Components reference implementations of TLS authentication, JWS signing of messages, and ILP packet generation used in the SDK Scheme Adapter. They offer a good reference for those wishing to use them, or implement their own. The Standard Components are provided in the Mojaloop GitHub repository: https://github.com/mojaloop/sdk-standard-components. *Question: Is this link correct?*

To integrate with a {hub} Hub leveraging the {sdk}, DFSPs are required to implement the simplified API for communication between their backend applications and the {sdk} Scheme Adapter.

DFSPs' backend must implement the following:

* Inbound API: This enables the Scheme Adapter to make incoming transfers to a DFSP, that is, to receive funds to a customer account.
* Outbound API: This enables the DFSP to make outgoing transfers via the Scheme Adapter, that is, to send funds from a customer account.

The following tables provide a summary of DFSP operations and API services that the {sdk} enables:

Transfers

|Request a transfer |`POST /transfers`
|Transfers a|
In the case of two-stage and three-stage transfers, continue a transfer that has paused after the party lookup or quote stage in order to accept or reject the party or quote, respectively

For details on multi-stage transfers, see xref:???.adoc[Single-stage, two-stage, and three-stage transfers].

|`PUT /transfers/{transferId}`
|  |Respond to `GET /transfers/{transferId}` | 
|  |Respond to `POST /requestToPay` | 
|Check transfer status a|
Retrieve information about a specific transfer

For best practice tips, see xref::???.adoc[Determining the status of a transfer].

|`GET /transfers/{transferId}`
|Payee initiates transaction (for example, when a merchant requests payment) a|
Payee requests funds from the Payer

(Phase 1 of Payee-initiated transaction)

For more information, see xref:???.adoc[Merchant transfers].

|`POST /requestToPay`
|Follow-up call to Payee-initiated transaction a|
Payer sends money in reponse to Payee's request for funds

(Phase 2 of Payee-initiated transaction)

For more information, see xref::???.adoc[Merchant transfers].

|`POST /requestToPayTransfer`
|Continue Payee-initiated transaction a|
Continue a transfer that has paused after the quote stage in order to accept or reject the quote

(Phase 2 of Payee-initiated transaction)

For more information, see xref:???.adoc[Merchant transfers].

|`PUT /requestToPayTransfer/{requestToPayTransactionId}`
|Bulk quote a|
Request a bulk quote for a group of financial transactions that the Payer DFSP wants to carry out in a single bulk transfer

For more information, see xref:???.adoc[Bulk quotes and bulk transfers].

|`POST /bulkQuotes`
|  |Retrieve information for a specific bulk quote |`GET /bulkQuotes/{bulkQuoteId}`
|Bulk transfer a|
Perform a bulk transfer sending money to multiple Payee accounts

For more information, see xref:???.adoc[Bulk quotes and bulk transfers].

|`POST /bulkTransfers`
|  |Retrieve information for a specific bulk transfer |`GET /bulkTransfers/{bulkTransferId}`
|Health check |Check health of Mojaloop-SDK |`GET /`
