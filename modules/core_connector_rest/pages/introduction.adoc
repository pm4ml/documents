= Introduction

At a high level, onboarding to a Mojaloop-based scheme requires a Digital Financial Service Provider (DFSP) to focus their efforts around the following major milestones:

* Integration of their Core Backend with the Mojaloop Switch on the API level (this involves both coding and testing).
* Connecting to Mojaloop pre-production and production environments following rigorous Mojaloop security requirements.

{product-name} for Mojaloop provides functionality to simplify both of these steps. This document provides details about API-level integration.

The following diagram provides a high-level view of the integration between a Mojaloop Real-Time Payment System and a DFSP's Core Backend.

{product-name} provides the following components:

* *{core-connector}*: Integrates a DFSP's Core Backend to Payment Manager as an "adapter" for both parts so communication is possible between them. It uses standard templates, the majority of them written in Apache Camel, a declarative language for integration engineers that does not require writing code from scratch. There is a ready-made {core-connector} template available for DFSPs to simplify their development effort.
* *{mojaloop-connector}*: Comes with the following key components:
** A _Mojaloop-SDK_, which provides:
*** Mojaloop-compliant security components
*** HTTP header processing capabilities
*** A simplified version of the Mojaloop FSPIOP API. {core-connector} will be talking to this API.
** A _{mcm-client}_, which simplifies and automates certificate creation, signing and exchange, as well as the configuration of the connections required to different environments.
* *Portals*: Provide dashboards for monitoring transactions and service status. They also allow DFSPs to manage their security keys, certificates and endpoint configuration required for connecting to a Mojaloop-based scheme in a guided way.

== {core-connector}

To communicate with {product-name}, DFSPs are required to implement {core-connector} in alignment with their backend technology so that it can call the {product-name} API (a simplified use-case-oriented version of the Mojaloop FSPIOP API). To help implementation efforts, DFSPs are provided with:

* the specification of the Payment Manager API
* a {core-connector} template

What is a {core-connector} template? DFSP Core Backends have their own custom API or enterprise integration solutions so multiple variants of {core-connector} have been built to align with common Core Banking Solution (CBS) products. These {core-connector} variants are all built using a standard template. The template provides a placeholder codebase for the API endpoints that need to be developed.

This document aims to provide guidance regarding a template that has been developed for REST-based implementations.

The chosen deployment option will influence the required integration effort on the DFSP's part. When deploying {product-name}, two options are available:
