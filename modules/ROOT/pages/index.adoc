= {product-name} for {hub}

Building, validating, and operating a service that connects a Digital Financial Service Provider's (DFSP's) core systems to a {hub} real-time payments network requires a detailed understanding of the business, technical, and operational requirements of that network. {company-name} makes the integration path to {hub} easier with {product-name}. 

{product-name} provides tools to manage connections, services, and transaction monitoring, and it also provides a single point to configure the DFSP environment to go from a test to a real-time one.

{product-name} is made up of the following major components:

* **Core Connector**: Integrates a DFSP's Core Backend to Payment Manager as a "translator" for both parts so communication is possible between them. Core Connector is also responsible for orchestrating the transfer flow and for the persistence of transfer data. It uses standard templates written in Apache Camel, a declarative language for integration engineers that does not require writing code from scratch.
* **Core {product-name}**: The main transaction service has the ability to manage, monitor, and report on different operational and technical processes from the Core and {hub} Connectors, as well as on the associated movement of transfers and funds.
* **{hub} Connector**: Comes with the following key components:
** A {hub}-SDK, which provides {hub}-compliant security components and HTTP header processing capabilities, as well as a simplified version of the {hub} API.
** A Connection Manager Client, which simplifies and automates certificate creation, signing and exchange, as well as the configuration of the connections required to different environments. This tool allows a DFSP to connect to the {hub} Hub and integrate with its internal
security requirements.
* **Business and Technical Portals**: Provide dashboards for monitoring liquidity, managing settlement and reconciliation, as well as customer support, troubleshooting and debugging. They also allow DFSPs to
manage their security keys, certificates and endpoint configuration required for connecting to {hub}-based schemes.

{product-name} abstracts away the complexity of the {hub} API and helps the DFSP understand their relationship with the scheme, focusing on the key business and technical areas.

{product-name} can reduce technical risk, as well as ongoing operational capability needs, thereby reducing costs for development and integration with a {hub} Hub. Enterprise Support is also offered by {company-name} to provide business confidence that there is continued investment in the solution and maintenance is available.

A few words about {product-name} technology:

* {product-name} is provided as a set of Linux container images (docker) and may be hosted on-premise using commodity server infrastructure or in appropriate cloud infrastructure where available.
* {product-name} scales from a very small footprint to handling many hundreds of transactions per second (dependent on the performance of the DFSPâ€™s Core Backend).
* {product-name} comes with turn-key integration options.
