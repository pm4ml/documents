= {product-name} OSS

Building, validating, and operating a service that connects a Digital Financial Service Provider's (DFSP's) core systems to a {hub} real-time payments network requires a detailed understanding of the business, technical, and operational requirements of that network. {product-name} makes the integration path to {hub} easier. 

{product-name} provides tools to manage connections, services, and transaction monitoring, and it also provides a single point to configure the DFSP environment to go from a test to a real-time one.

{product-name} is made up of the following major components:

* **{core-connector}**: Integrates a DFSP's Core Backend to Payment Manager as an "adapter" for both parts so communication is possible between them. It uses standard templates, the majority of them written in Apache Camel, a declarative language for integration engineers that does not require writing code from scratch.
* **{mojaloop-connector}**: Comes with the following key components:
** A {hub}-SDK, which provides {hub}-compliant security components and HTTP header processing capabilities, as well as a simplified version of the {hub} API.
** A Connection Manager Client, which simplifies and automates certificate creation, signing and exchange, as well as the configuration of the connections required to different environments.
* **Business and Technical Portals**: Provide dashboards for monitoring transactions and service status. They also allow DFSPs to manage their security keys, certificates and endpoint configuration required for connecting to {hub}-based schemes.

{product-name} abstracts away the complexity of the {hub} API and helps the DFSP understand their relationship with the scheme, focusing on the key business and technical areas.

{product-name} can reduce technical risk, as well as ongoing operational capability needs, thereby reducing costs for development and integration with a {hub} Hub.

A few words about {product-name} technology:

* {product-name} is provided as a set of Linux container images (docker) and may be hosted on-premise using commodity server infrastructure or in appropriate cloud infrastructure where available.
* {product-name} scales from a very small footprint to handling many hundreds of transactions per second (dependent on the performance of the DFSPâ€™s Core Backend).
* {product-name} comes with turn-key integration options.
