The Net Debit Cap (NDC) check (Step 15 in the diagram) that the Mojaloop Switch performs serves to ensure that the Payer DFSP always has enough liquidity to cover their outgoing transfers. The NDC is a limit or a cap placed on a DFSPâ€™s funds available for transacting. It represents the maximum amount of money that the DFSP can owe to other DFSPs. For each transfer request, the Switch checks whether or not executing the transfer would result in a breach of the NDC. If yes, the Switch blocks the transfer.
