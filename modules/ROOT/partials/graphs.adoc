To be able to zoom, you must be in selection zoom mode. Ensure you have the *Selection Zoom* button image:ROOT:selection_zoom_button.png[width=22,height=21] selected. This is the default setting. 

Click the *Zoom In* or *Zoom Out* buttons image:ROOT:zoom_in_zoom_out.png[width=44,height=26] to zoom in or out. To zoom in on a particular area of the graph, select an area by clicking the graph, drag the mouse left or right, and release the mouse.

Click the *Reset Zoom* button image:ROOT:house_button.png[width=23,height=23] to reset the timeline to the original 24-hour granularity.

Another way to change the displayed range of the timeline is to pan an area. Click the *Panning* button image:ROOT:panning_button.png[width=25,height=25], then click the timeline and drag your mouse to the left or right. Panning keeps the selected zoom granularity and lets you move along the X (time) axis.

To return to selection zoom mode, click the *Selection Zoom* button image:ROOT:selection_zoom_button.png[width=22,height=21].
