= Integration as a Payee DFSP

The following diagram illustrates how a Payee DFSP interacts with {product-name} and the Mojaloop Switch at the level of API calls.

The interface between the Mojaloop Switch and the {mojaloop-connector} is the https://docs.mojaloop.io/mojaloop-specification/#api-definition[asynchronous Mojaloop FSPIOP API].

The simplified API between the {mojaloop-connector} and the {core-connector} is a synchronous HTTP API ({product-name} API: `mojaloop_payment_manager_API.yaml`).

== Example error response to `POST /transfers`

The following example shows a response to a `POST /transfers` request when the request fails in the Payee DFSP (for example, a check to ensure that the customer does not receive money above a certain amount per transfer fails) (Step 73 in the diagram above).

== Example success response to `POST /transfers`

The following example shows a response to a `POST /transfers` request when the request is successful (Step 84 in the diagram above).

When the Payee DFSP is informed about the incoming transfer request, it performs internal checks (for example, a check to ensure that the customer does not receive money above a certain amount per transfer). If all checks pass, it reserves funds and confirms that they are OK to go ahead with the transfer.

== Example `PUT /transfers/{transferId}` notification

The following example shows a `PUT /transfers/{transferId}` notification (Step 93 in the diagram above) when:

* the Payee DFSP has confirmed that they are OK to go ahead with the transfer, and
* the transfer fails validation of the fulfilment and expiry timestamp in the Switch

The notification acts as a failure notice, indicating to the Payee DFSP that they should not release funds to their customer's account as the transfer did not happen.

The following example shows a `PUT /transfers/{transferId}` notification (Step 102 in the diagram above) when:

* the Payee DFSP has confirmed that they are OK to go ahead with the transfer, and
* the transfer passes validation of the fulfilment and expiry timestamp in the Switch

The notification acts as a success confirmation, indicating to the Payee DFSP that they can go ahead and release funds to their customer's account.

To ensure that the Switch does send a notification, the following environment variables must be configured:

* `RESERVE_NOTIFICATION` must be set to `true`
* `RESOURCE_VERSIONS` must contain the string `transfers=1.1` 

`RESOURCE_VERSIONS` is used to assign API versions to `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers dynamically. Given that the Switch notification is a feature that was introduced in Mojaloop FSPIOP API version 1.1, and that it is a feature of the `/transfers` resource, {product-name} must be set so that it uses version 1.1. of the `/transfers` resource. Here is how to set resource versions:

----
RESOURCE_VERSIONS="resouceOneName=1.0,resourceTwoName=1.1"
----

For example:

----
RESOURCE_VERSIONS="parties=1.0,transfers=1.1"
----
