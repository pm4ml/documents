= Introduction

At a high level, onboarding to a Mojaloop-based scheme requires a Digital Financial Service Provider (DFSP) to focus their efforts around the following major milestones:

* Integration of their Core Backend with the Mojaloop Switch on the API level (this involves both coding and testing).
* Connecting to Mojaloop pre-production and production environments following rigorous Mojaloop security requirements.

{product-name} for Mojaloop provides functionality to simplify both of these steps. This document provides details about API-level integration.

The following diagram provides a high-level view of the integration between a Mojaloop Real-Time Payment System and a DFSP's Core Backend.

{product-name} provides the following components:

* *{core-connector}*: Integrates a DFSP’s Core Backend to {product-name} as a "translator" for both parts so communication is possible between them. It is built in Apache Camel, a declarative language for integration engineers that does not require writing code from scratch. There is a ready-made {core-connector} template available for DFSPs to simplify their development effort.
* *{mojaloop-connector}*: Comes with the following key components:
** A _Mojaloop-SDK_, which provides:
*** Mojaloop-compliant security components
*** HTTP header processing capabilities
*** A simplified use-case-oriented version of the Mojaloop FSPIOP API. This API is called Payment Manager API. DFSPs will be talking to this API, leveraging {core-connector}.
** A _{mcm-client}_, which simplifies and automates certificate creation, signing and exchange, as well as the configuration of the connections required to different environments.
* *Portals*: Provide dashboards for monitoring transactions and service status. They also allow DFSPs to manage their security keys, certificates and endpoint configuration required for connecting to a Mojaloop-based scheme in a guided way.
