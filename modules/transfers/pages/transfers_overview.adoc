The granularity of the graph is customizable. For example, you can zoom in on areas of interest and find out the timestamps of transfers that seem not to have been successful.

To be able to zoom, you must be in selection zoom mode. Ensure you have the *Selection Zoom* button image:selection_zoom_button.png[width=22,height=21] selected. This is the default setting. 

Click the *Zoom In* or *Zoom Out* buttons image:zoom_in_zoom_out.png[width=44,height=26] to zoom in or out. To zoom in on a particular area of the graph, select an area by clicking the graph, drag the mouse left or right, and release the mouse.

Click the *Reset Zoom* button image:house_button.png[width=23,height=23] to reset the timeline to the original 24-hour granularity.

Another way to change the displayed range of the timeline is to pan an area. Click the *Panning* button image:panning_button.png[width=25,height=25], then click the timeline and drag your mouse to the left or right. Panning keeps the selected zoom granularity and lets you move along the X (time) axis.

To return to selection zoom mode, click the *Selection Zoom* button image:selection_zoom_button.png[width=22,height=21].
