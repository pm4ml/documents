= Getting started with Keycloak

== Admin Console

The Admin Console is the Keycloak user interface that enables administrators to manage user accounts and access to {product-name}. 

As an administrator of {product-name} user accounts, you need the following:

* An admin account to the Admin Console. +
This is created by the Infrastructure team deploying {product-name}. The admin account must be set up so that it has permissions to manage only the relevant realm. 
* The URL to the Admin Console. +
This is also provided by the Infrastructure team.
* VPN access to the Admin Console.

NOTE: In the case of a cloud deployment, VPN access can be requested through the https://support.modusbox.com[{company-name} Enterprise Support portal].

For further information on the Admin Console, see section https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#admin-console[Admin Console] in the *Keycloak Server Administration Guide*.

== Prerequisites

To be able to add user accounts to manage access to {product-name}, the {product-name} application itself must be set up in Keycloak first:

. A realm or realms must be configured.
. The {product-name} user interface must be registered as a client of Keycloak.

This section provides details about these two prerequisites.

=== Realms

In the case of an on-premise deployment, {product-name} comes with an out-of-the-box *Pm4ml* realm (**Pm4ml** stands for {product-name} for Mojaloop). A realm can be thought of as an isolated domain, in this case, that domain is the {product-name} application. Anything within the *Pm4ml* realm relates to the {product-name} instance.

In the case of a SaaS cloud deployment, there will always be one realm per DFSP.

The *Pm4ml* realm has some pre-configured settings. You can find these settings under the *Realm Settings* menu item, displayed in the left-hand navigation pane. On clicking *Realm Settings*, various tabs are displayed in the right-hand pane.

Some of the key settings on the *General* and *Login* tabs are highlighted in the table below.

TIP: Click the links in the table to find out further details about the individual settings.

.Realm Settings
[width="100%",options="header", cols="2,5"]
|====================
| Tab |  Setting
| *General* |  *Name:* This is the name of the *Pm4ml* realm.
|  |  *Enabled: ON* +
 +
This is required because a realm can only be accessed if it is enabled.
|  | *Display name:* Payment Manager for Mojaloop +
 +
The name specified here is the name that is displayed on the Keycloak sign-in page when the user logs in to {product-name}.
|  |  *User-Managed Access: OFF* +
 +
If this is set to **ON**, users can manage access to protected resources. For further details, see section https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/#_service_user_managed_access[User-Managed Access] in the **Keycloak Authorization Services Guide**.
|  |  *Endpoints:* *OpenID Endpoint Configuration* and *SAML 2.0 Identity Provider Metadata*
| **Login** | *User registration: OFF* +
 +
This is required so that {product-name} users are not able to create an account for themselves, and user accounts are always created by an admin person.
|  | *Edit username: OFF* +
 +
If this is set to **OFF**, the user's username is not allowed to be updated.
|  | https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#forgot-password[*Forgot password: ON*] +
 +
When enabled, users are able to reset their credentials if they forget their password or lose their OTP generator. 
|  | https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#remember-me[*Remember Me: OFF*] +
 +
When disabled, if a logged-in user closes their browser, their session is destroyed and they will have to log in again.
|  | *Verify email: OFF* +
 +
When disabled, the user will not get a verification email on registering the user.
|  | *Login with email: ON* +
 +
When enabled, the user can log in using their email address.
|  | https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_ssl_modes[**Require SSL: external requests**] +
 +
Keycloak requires a secure connection when accessing {product-name} from a non-private IP address.
| *Token* | The settings on this tab enable you to configure how you want the refresh of xref:user_authentication.adoc[access tokens] to happen, how long a session can be live or idle, and so on.

=== Clients

Clients in Keycloak are entities that can request the authentication of a user. The {product-name} application is one such entity, which has to be registered to the {product-name} realm.

The {product-name} user interface (**pm4ml-customer-ui**) is registered as a client to the {product-name} realm by default. 

NOTE: Clients other than **pm4ml-customer-ui** are Keycloak's own clients necessary for the correct operation of Keycloak. Do not modify client settings unless you have a particular requirement and the consequences of your actions (reduced security) are fully understood.

.Clients

On clicking **pm4ml-customer-ui**, the settings associated with it are displayed. Some key settings are highlighted below.

.Clients
[width="100%",options="header", cols="2,5"]
|====================
| Tab |  Setting
| *Settings* | *Root URL:* Specifies the URL where the {product-name} user interface is accessible to users of {product-name}.
| *Credentials* | *Client Athenticator: Client id and Secret* +
 +
This setting is required so that the {product-name} Experience API can identify itself securely to Keycloak. The secret is automatically generated, and the *Regenerate Secret* button allows you to recreate this secret if you want to or need to. +
 +
*NOTE:* You get a new client secret every time you restart Keycloak (Keycloak refreshes all its keys if the database that holds the keys loses its state).
