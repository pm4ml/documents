= Introduction

{product-name} comes with an identity provider component built into the product, which serves as a repository of identities and allows for the granting of role-based access to users of the {product-name} portals (the {connection-wizard}, the {transfers}, and the {tech-dashboard}). User access management within the context of {product-name} means:

* creating user accounts from scratch or tying into an existing Active Directory/LDAP user database by federation
* assigning roles to users or mapping roles from an existing user database to roles created in {product-name}'s identity provider
* group membership definition
* setting up an authentication method for users
* password policy management and password storage
* account recovery and user credentials management

{product-name} leverages the https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] identity provider and implements the https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] authentication protocol. OpenID Connect is an OAuth 2.0 protocol, which helps authenticate users and convey information about them. 

The following diagram illustrates where the identity provider is situated within {product-name} architecture.

Where there is no existing identity provider, the identiy provider will be Keycloak. Alternatively, when there is an existing OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect compliant identity service that the Digital Financial Services Provider (DFSP) already has, then that will be used in place of Keycloak.

In the case of an on-premise deployment, there can be one Keycloak instance per {product-name} instance. Whereas for a cloud-hosted SaaS deployment, the Keycloak instance could be shared across various {product-name} instances.
