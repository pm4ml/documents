= Introduction

At a high level, onboarding to a Mojaloop-based scheme requires a Digital Financial Service Provider (DFSP) to focus their efforts around the following major milestones:

* Integration of their Core Backend with the Mojaloop Switch on the API level (this involves both coding and testing).
* Connecting to Mojaloop pre-production and production environments following rigorous Mojaloop security requirements.

{product-name} for Mojaloop provides functionality to simplify both of these steps. This document provides details about API-level integration.

The following diagram provides a high-level view of the integration between a Mojaloop Real-Time Payment System and a DFSP's Core Backend.

{product-name} provides the following components:

* *{core-connector}*: Integrates a DFSP’s Core Backend to {product-name} as a "translator" for both parts so communication is possible between them. It is built in Apache Camel, a declarative language for integration engineers that does not require writing code from scratch. There is a ready-made {core-connector} template available for DFSPs to simplify their development effort.
* *{mojaloop-connector}*: Comes with the following key components:
** A _Mojaloop-SDK_, which provides:
*** Mojaloop-compliant security components
*** HTTP header processing capabilities
*** A simplified use-case-oriented version of the Mojaloop FSPIOP API. This API is called Payment Manager API. DFSPs will be talking to this API, leveraging {core-connector}.
** A _{mcm-client}_, which simplifies and automates certificate creation, signing and exchange, as well as the configuration of the connections required to different environments.
* *Portals*: Provide dashboards for monitoring transactions and service status. They also allow DFSPs to manage their security keys, certificates and endpoint configuration required for connecting to a Mojaloop-based scheme in a guided way.

== {core-connector}

To communicate with {product-name}, DFSPs are required to implement {core-connector} in alignment with their backend technology so that it can call the {product-name} API. To help implementation efforts, DFSPs are provided with:

* the specification of the Payment Manager API
* a {core-connector} template

What is a {core-connector} template? DFSP Core Backends have their own custom API or enterprise integration solutions so {company-name} built multiple variants of {core-connector} to align with common Core Banking Solution (CBS) products. These {core-connector} variants are all built using a standard template. The template provides a placeholder codebase for the API endpoints that need to be developed.

The effort to customise a {core-connector} template will differ depending on the transfer use case and on whether the DFSP will be transacting in a Payer DFSP (send funds) role or a Payee DFSP (receive funds) role. Payment Manager currently provides support for the peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer use case only. For the P2P use case: 

* As a Payer DFSP, there is no need for any customisation, the template comes with the fully-fledged implementation of the functionality to send funds.
* As a Payee DFSP, the DFSP must add the implementation logic for calling the Core Backend using the appropriate CBS technology.

For any other use case (for example, payee-initiated merchant transfers), both the Payer DFSP and the Payee DFSP are required to customise the {core-connector} template.

In addition to the DFSP role, the chosen deployment option will also influence the required integration effort on the DFSP’s part. When deploying {product-name}, two options are available:

* **Hosted by {company-name}**: {company-name} integration experts deploy {product-name}, sync up the {core-connector} template with the DFSP's core backend implementation, and set any required configuration options.
* **Self-hosted by DFSP**: The DFSP deploys {product-name}, aligns the {core-connector} template with the specifics of their backend technology, and configures any additional settings.
