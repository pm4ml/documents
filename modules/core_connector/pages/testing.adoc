= Testing {core-connector}

== Testing locally 

=== Testing the sending side

When testing the sending side, you can use Postman to make a call directly to the {core-connector} of the sending side, and check if the {core-connector} is making a call to the {mojaloop-connector} SDK using the right message format.

To test the sending side, follow these steps:

. Build the {core-connector} Maven project:
.. Change directory to `client-adapter-interface`.
.. Issue the `mvn clean install` command.
. Run `java -jar client-adapter/target/client-adapter-1.0.0.jar`.
. To test `POST /sendmoney`, in Postman, issue a `POST /sendmoney` request to where {core-connector} is running locally. +
 +
Remove/set headers as indicated in the `from("direct:postSendmoney")` route in the Apache Camel router.
. To test `PUT /sendmoney/{transferId}`, in Postman, issue a `PUT /sendmoney/{transferId}` request to where {core-connector} is running locally. +
 +
Remove/set headers as indicated in the `from("direct:putSendmoneyById")` route in the Apache Camel router.

=== Testing the receiving side

When testing the receiving side, you can use Postman to make a call directly to the {core-connector} of the receiving side.

The DFSP Core Backend will either be a sandbox environment of the DFSP backend, or -- if you do not have access to that for some reason -- you can mock up the backend based on the Swagger specification of the DFSP backend API (provided to you by the DFSP CBS vendor) and use dummy responses. An example of the latter solution (developed for the T24 CBS vendor) is found in the https://github.com/modusintegration/mojaloop-cbs-adapter-template[mojaloop-cbs-adapter-template repository], in `client-adapter-soap-mock/src/main/java/com/modus/client/mock/temenos/`. Alternatively, you can use Postman or SoapUI to create a mock version of the DFSP backend.

==== Testing against a sandbox DFSP backend 

To test the receiving side, follow these steps:

. Build the {core-connector} Maven project:
.. Change directory to `client-adapter-interface`.
.. Issue the `mvn clean install` command.
. Run `java -jar client-adapter/target/client-adapter-1.0.0.jar`.
. In Postman, issue the relevant request (`GET /parties/{idType}/{idValue}`, `POST /quoterequests`, `POST /transfers`) to the DFSP backend running in the sandbox environment:
.. Retrieve the sandbox url from the `client-adapter/src/main/resources/application.yaml` file and add it in the request URL field in Postman. +
.. To authenticate yourself to the DFSP backend, take the username and password from the `client-adapter/src/main/resources/application.yaml` file, and base64-encode the `username:password` string (for example, using base64encode.org).
.. In Postman, set *Authorization* to *Basic Auth* and provide the username and password.
.. In Postman, on the *Headers* tab, enter the *Authorization* key, and set the value to `Basic <base64-encoded username:password string>`.
.. Remove/set additional headers as indicated in the relevant `from("direct:<request-name>")` route in the Apache Camel router.
.. Click **Send**.
.. Check the response in the *Response* pane.

==== Testing against a mock DFSP backend

To test the receiving side, follow these steps:

. Make sure you have provided the following value in the `client-adapter/src/main/resources/application.yaml` file: +
----
outbound
	endpoint: http://localhost:<port-where-mock-DFSP-backend-is-running>
----
. Build the {core-connector} Maven project:
.. Change directory to `client-adapter-interface`.
.. Issue the `mvn clean install` command.
. Run `java -jar client-adapter/target/client-adapter-1.0.0.jar`.
. In Postman, issue the relevant request (`GET /parties/{idType}/{idValue}`, `POST /quoterequests`, `POST /transfers`) to the mock DFSP backend:
.. Retrieve the url and port number from the `client-adapter/src/main/resources/application.yaml` file and add it in the request URL field in Postman. +
.. Remove/set headers as indicated in the relevant `from("direct:<request-name>")` route in the Apache Camel router.
.. Click **Send**.
.. Check the response in the *Response* pane.

== End-to-end testing

The Hub Operator will have set up a QA environment with simulator DFSPs and a Switch. Once changes have been deployed in the QA environment, you can perform end-to-end testing leveraging the simulators and the Switch. 

== Unit testing

Route-level and bean-level changes have to be tested individually, this is done using the Apache Camel testing framework. You can think of this as "black-box testing" where you are only validating the response.

In addition, individual DataSonnet mappings must be tested too. An example of such tests is provided in the https://github.com/modusintegration/mojaloop-cbs-adapter-template[mojaloop-cbs-adapter-template repository], in `client-adapter/src/test/java/com/modus/client/`.
