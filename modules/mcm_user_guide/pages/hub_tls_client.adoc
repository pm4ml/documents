= Managing TLS client certificates

The TLS Client Certificates page allows you to:

* *<<hub-csr,CSR>>* tab: Submit a certificate signing request (CSR) to a DFSP to request that your TLS client certificate be signed by a DFSP's CA. 
* *<<retrieve-hub-csr,Sent CSRs>>* tab: View the status of sent CSRs and view or download the CSR or the signed certificate itself. 
* *<<sign-dfsp-csr,Unprocessed DFSP CSRs>>* tab: Manage DFSP CSRs, that is, view and download CSRs and certificates, sign certificates, and upload signed certificates. 

== Creating a Hub certificate signing request [[hub-csr]]

.Creating a certificate signing request

To create a certificate signing request (CSR) for sending to a DFSP, complete the following steps:

include::partial$note_rename_file.adoc[]

This means that when uploading a certificate to {mcm-short}, you will see the original file name of your certificate change to a value assigned by {mcm-short}.

. Go to the *CSR* tab.
. In the *Requested DFSP* field, select the DFSP that you want to send the CSR to.
. In the *CSR Type* field, select how you want to create the CSR:
* To upload a CSR already created:
.. Select **Upload CSR**.
.. In the *CSR* field, click **Choose File**, and select the CSR file saved on your computer. +
include::partial$note_replace_wrong_csr.adoc[]
.. Go to Step 4.
* To manually create a CSR:
.. Select **Manual Entry**. Note that this option is only available if you have already set up the Hub CA.
.. Fill in the fields displayed, they are all mandatory: **Common Name**, **Email**, **Organization**, **Organization Unit**. +
*NOTE:* Some additional mandatory fields are currently not displayed and hence cannot be specified here, they are: Locality, State, Country. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of the product.
.. Optionally, fill in the *DNS* and *IP* fields under **Extensions**.
.. Go to Step 4.
. Click *Submit* to send the CSR to the DFSP.

== Retrieving the Hub's TLS client certificate CSR signed by a DFSP [[retrieve-hub-csr]]

.Retrieving a signed CSR
image::hub_sent_csr.png[]

To retrieve a TLS client certificate signed by a DFSP, complete the following steps:

. Go to the *Sent CSRs* tab. You can search for a sent CSR by typing a keyword (such as the DFSP's name) in the *Search Sent CSRs* search box and pressing **Enter**. +
The *Status* indicator displays the status of your sent CSR. If it says **Certificate created**, then that means that the CSR has been signed by the receiving DFSP.
. You can click *Validate Certificate* to check the validity of your signed certificate. The following details are validated:
* The CSR's signature must match the public key.
* The CSR's signature algorithm must be "sha256WithRSAEncryption". Note that the validation also accepts "sha512WithRSAEncryption".
* The CSR public key length must be 4096 bits.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same public key.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same Subject information.
* The CSR must have all mandatory Distinguished Name attributes. These are: Common Name (CN), Organizational Unit (OU), Organization (O), Locality (L), State (ST), Country (+C+), and Email Address (E).
* The certificate public key must match the private key used to sign the CSR. Only available if the CSR was manually created ({mcm-short} has the private key) instead of uploaded.
* The certificate must be valid at the present time according to the certificate validity period.
* The certificate's signature algorithm must be "sha256WithRSAEncryption".
* The certificate must be signed by the DFSP CA.
. Click *Download Certificate* to download your signed certificate, which is now ready to be installed in the outbound API gateway.

== Signing a DFSP's TLS client certificate CSR [[sign-dfsp-csr]]

.Signing a DFSP's TLS client certificate CSR

After a DFSP has sent a CSR for their TLS client certificate, you are able to retrieve it for signature. To sign a DFSP's TLS client certificate CSR using the CA set up on the *Certificate Authorities* page, complete the following steps:

. Go to the *Unprocessed DFSP CSRs* tab. You can search for a sent CSR by typing a keyword in the *Search Sent CSRs* search box and pressing **Enter**.
. To sign the DFSP's CSR using the embedded CA, click **Use Provided CA To Sign CSR**. This will use the CA set up on the *Certificate Authorities* page to sign the CSR. +
The *Status* indicator will change to *CSR created* to indicate that signing the DFSP's CSR has been successful. +
Information about the validity of the certificate will also be displayed. Click *View Details* for information on possible validity issues. The following details are validated:
* The CSR's signature algorithm must be sha256WithRSAEncryption. Note that the validation also accepts sha512WithRSAEncryption.
* The CSR public key length must be 4096 bits.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same public key.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same Subject information.
* The CSR must have all mandatory Distinguished Name attributes. These are: Common Name (CN), Organizational Unit (OU), Organization (O), Locality (L), State (ST), Country (+C+), and Email Address (E).
* The certificate public key must match the private key used to sign the CSR. Only available if the CSR was manually created ({mcm-short} has the private key) instead of uploaded.

To sign a DFSP's TLS client certificate CSR using an external third-party CA, complete the following steps:

NOTE: For this option to work, you must have uploaded external Hub CA certificates through the *Certificate Authorities* page > the *HUB External Certificate Authority* tab.

. Go to the *Unprocessed DFSP CSRs* tab. You can search for a sent CSR by typing a keyword in the *Search Sent CSRs* search box and pressing **Enter**.
. To sign the DFSP's CSR using an external CA, click **Upload Certificate**. This will use the external CA recorded on the *Certificate Authorities* page > *HUB External Certificate Authority* tab to sign the CSR. +
The *Upload certificate* pop-up window will be displayed, prompting you to select the CA you want to use to sign the DFSP's CSR.
. In the *Certificate* field, click *Choose File* and select the relevant external CA. This will fill in the *External CA* field with the name of the CA that you have selected.
. Click *Choose File* again, and select the root certificate of the CA saved on your computer. +
image:upload_certificate_popup.png[weight=566 height=500]
. Click **Save**. +
The *Status* indicator will change to *CSR created* to indicate that signing the DFSP's CSR has been successful. +
Information about the validity of the certificate will also be displayed. Click *View Details* for information on possible validity issues. The following details are validated:
* The CSR's signature algorithm must be sha256WithRSAEncryption. Note that the validation also accepts sha512WithRSAEncryption.
* The CSR public key length must be 4096 bits.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same public key.
* The CSR and certificate must have the same Subject information.
* The CSR must have all mandatory Distinguished Name attributes. These are: Common Name (CN), Organizational Unit (OU), Organization (O), Locality (L), State (ST), Country (+C+), and Email Address (E).
* The certificate public key must match the private key used to sign the CSR. Only available if the CSR was manually created ({mcm-short} has the private key) instead of uploaded.

You can also download the signed certificate for installation in the API gateway trust store. To do that, click **Download Certificate**.

NOTE: When downloading an uploaded certificate, the default extension is set to `.csr`. If you wish to download the certificate in another format (for example, `.cer`), in the *Save As* dialog box, edit the file name and the file type so you get the certificate in the required format.
