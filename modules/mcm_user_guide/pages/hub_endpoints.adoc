= Configuring and processing endpoints

Pages in the *General* menu allow you to:

* *<<endpoint-config,Endpoint Configuration>>* page: Record your outbound and inbound endpoints for sharing with DFSPs.
* *<<process-endpoints,Unprocessed Endpoints>>* page: Retrieve endpoint information submitted by DFSPs.

== Configuring Hub outbound and inbound endpoints [[endpoint-config]]

The *Endpoint Configuration* page allows you to specify:

* *<<egress,Egress Endpoints>>* tab: Outbound endpoints, that is, the IP addresses from which the Hub will initiate connections to DFSPs.
* *<<ingress,Ingress Endpoints>>* tab: Inbound endpoints, that is, the Hub URLs / IP addresses that DFSPs will initiate connections to.

As you are entering data, it is being validated. If invalid data is entered, a tooltip is displayed to help you resolve the issue.

If you wish to clear all data in one click, click the *Undo Changes* button.
