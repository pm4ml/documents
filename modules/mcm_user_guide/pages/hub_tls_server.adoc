* The root certificate is a root certificate indeed. It can be self-signed or signed by a global root.
* The intermediate chain is made up of valid CAs and the top of the chain is signed by the root.
* The certificate and its chain must form a valid trust chain.

== Retrieving a DFSP's TLS server certificate chain [[retrieve-dfsp-cert]]

.Retrieving a DFSP's TLS server certificate chain

The Hub must obtain the root and intermediate certificates of the DFSP's CA that signed the DFSP TLS server certificate. These need to be installed in the outbound API gateway.

To retrieve a DFSP's TLS server certificate chain after they have uploaded it:

. Go to the *DFSPs Server Certificates* tab. +
Information about the validity of the server certificate is also displayed. Click *View Details* for details on validation. The following details are validated:
* The root certificate is a root certificate indeed. It can be self-signed or signed by a global root.
* The intermediate chain is made up of valid CAs and the top of the chain is signed by the root.
* The certificate and its chain must form a valid trust chain.
* The certificate must have the "TLS WWW server authentication" key usage extension.
* The certificate must be valid at the present time according to the certificate validity period.
* The certificate key length must be 4096 bits.
. Click *Download* for each certificate that you want to download.
