= Introduction to {mcm-long}

Setting up Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for a new Mojaloop environment and subsequently onboarding Digital Financial Service Providers (DFSPs) involves a number of steps around the generation, signing, and sharing of certificates, as well as identifying the various endpoints required to establish connections. DFSPs and the Hub communicate over TLSv1.2 with mutually authenticated X.509 certificates, which are signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The use of digital certificates is necessary to verify the identity of the parties exchanging data with each other and ensure secure communications. In addition to TLS client and server certificates, all DFSPs and the Hub itself must have a JSON Web Signature (JWS) certificate, which they then share among themselves.

Previous experience shows that the certificate management process is prone to human errors. To reduce the probability of mistakes and miscommunication, a connectivity management tool, {mcm-long} ({mcm-short}), has been developed, which allows the Hub Operator to exchange endpoint data and certificates with DFSPs through an easy-to-use portal.

The following diagram provides an illustration of how information gets exchanged between {product-name} (its component called MCM Client) and the {mcm-short} portal (which pulls data from the MCM Server).

{mcm-short} has functionality to support the following steps of endpoint mapping and certificate management for the Hub Operator.
