== Setting up a Hub Certificate Authority (CA) [[set-up-hub-ca]]

The Certificate Authorities page allows you to:

* *HUB Certificate Authority* tab: set up an embedded CA for the Hub
* *HUB External Certificate Authority* tab: upload the root and intermediate certificates of a trusted third-party CA

A Hub CA is required so that you can create client certificate signing requests (CSRs) using the parameters provided in the {mcm-short} portal.

The *Certificate Authorities* page > *HUB Certificate Authority* tab lets you set up an embedded CA for the Hub.

To upload the root certificate and intermediate chain of an external CA, complete the following steps:

include::partial$note_rename_file.adoc[]

This means that when uploading a certificate to {mcm-short}, you will see the original file name of your certificate change to a value assigned by {mcm-short}.

. To upload the root certificate of your external CA, click *Choose File* in the *Root Certificate* field, and select the root certificate of your CA saved on your computer.
. To upload the intermediate certificate of your external CA, click *Choose File* in the *Intermediate Chain* field, and select the intermediate certificate of your CA saved on your computer. +
 +
*NOTE:* The intermediate chain must be presented as a single file. If your intermediate chain is made up of multiple files, combine them into one file in the following order: host certificate first, then the certificate that signs it, then the certificate that signs the previous certificate, and so on. Go from the most specific certificate to the least specific certificate, with each certificate verifying the previous one.
. In the *Name* field, type a meaningful name for your external CA.
. Click **Submit**. On submitting the certificates, they are validated. The following details are validated:
* The root certificate is a root certificate indeed. It can be self-signed or signed by a global root.
* The root certificate has the CA basic contraint extension ( CA = true ).
* The intermediate chain is made up of valid CAs and the top of the chain is signed by the root.
* The certificate and its chain must form a valid trust chain.
. The certificates are displayed at the bottom of the page. To view or download them, click *View* or **Download**.

NOTE: If you have accidentally uploaded the wrong certificate, you can re-upload a new certificate and that will replace the old one.

== Retrieving the certificates of a DFSP's CA [[retrieve-dfsp-ca]]

The *Certificate Authorities* page > *DFSP Certificate Authority* tab gives you access to the root and intermediate certificates of DFSPs' CAs for importing into your trust store after they have uploaded it.
